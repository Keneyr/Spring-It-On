Spring-It-On: The Game Developer's Spring-Roll-Call
===================================================

This repo contains the source code for all the demos from [this article](http://theorangeduck.com/page/spring-roll-call). 

It uses [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) or more specifically [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) so if you have that installed it should be easy to play around and try them out.

## Run

C:\raylib\w64devkit\w64devkit.exe

cd d:\Sprint-It-On

make
